My name is Omi Gibba and I am a Front End Developer student at Medieinstitutet, Stockholm.

This application is based on the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview). It lets users search for books in the Google Books catalogue. The search results shows title, author, publication date, country, category, description, Google Books link and average rating.

View the project [here](http://omigibba.se/omi_gibba_ajax/) and [here](https://github.com/omigibson/Ajax).

I have used the following technologies to build this.
* HTML5
* SASS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap

The [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview) gives access to many of the operations available on Google Books website. Some of the main features that the API provides are:
1. searching and browsing through the list of books that match a given query.
2. viewing information about a book, including metadata, availability and price, links to the preview page.
3. managing of bookshelves.

I started my work process with just getting to know the API and what kind of information I could get out of it. I chose what I thought was the most relevant information for a book search and then did a quick scetch on [moqups.com/](https://moqups.com/) of how I would present the information on a website.

Since I am still new at Javascript, there are a lot of things that could be improved in my code.

Also, if I had the time I would connect this app to more book API:s for better search results. It would also be good with links to reviews of books.
